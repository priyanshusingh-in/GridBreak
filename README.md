# GridBreak

GridBreak is an Android application that
implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game
with both offline and online multiplayer
functionalities. This project demonstrates
the practical application of the array and
list data structures in mobile game
development. The app utilizes arrays and
mutable lists for game state management
and integrates Firebase Firestore for
online play. GridBreak offers users three
play options: offline mode, creating an
online game, and joining an existing
online game. The development process
provided valuable insights into Android
app development, real-time database
management, and user interface design.
